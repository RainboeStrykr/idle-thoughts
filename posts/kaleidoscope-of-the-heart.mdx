Love is not just one thing, it has a vast amount of meanings and definitions. It is a complex and profound emotion that transcends boundaries. It is both a force of nature and a reflection of our humanity. Love is not limited by time, space, or circumstance, but rather exists in the realm of the eternal. Love is not solely about receiving, but about giving without expectation, and finding meaning in the act of giving itself. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not limited to romantic relationships but encompasses a wide spectrum of connections, from familial bonds to platonic friendships. It is a source of joy, pain, and growth, shaping our perceptions and experiences of the world. Love is a powerful force that has the ability to transform, heal, and unite. It reflects the deepest truths and mysteries of our existence.

In this anthology, I have tried to briefly express a few emotions that can be categorized under the enormous heading that is Love.

If you like this collection and if I was able to make you feel any one of these poems, do give this a share!

## Immortal

My heart beats fast, my palms are sweaty,   
Every time I see you, I'm feeling unsteady   
You're the one I dream of day and night,   
But my love for you remains out of sight.   

My mind does battle, the heart in pain   
As it tries to accept and not love in vain   
But still, my heart aches, with every beat   
For the love, it cannot meet   

I've tried to show you how I feel,   
But my attempts always seem to fail.   
I long for you to hold me close,   
But I'm left with nothing but a heart that's broke.   

My love blooms, but cannot thrive   
It's a pain that will forever survive   
A wound that cannot heal or close   
As the love in my heart forever glows   

I know that you don't feel the same,   
And yet I'm still the one to blame.   
I can't help how I feel inside,   
But I know I must swallow my pride.   

So I'll love you from afar,   
And hold on to this love like a shining star.   
As even though it's unrequited,   
My love for you will never be uninvited.

## The moon to my Sky

Your eyes talked about love in a thousand different languages.
Those eyes fell on me and I spiraled.

You are the one I would look for in a crowded room
You wear a smile that could make any dead flower bloom
You stand close to my soul
Your existence makes me whole

All you had to do was look at me
And your hushed glances hold poems, paper cannot handle

Yes, you are half my heart
Without you, I will fall apart

I want to be a part of your hurricane
And love you through every pain

Crossed oceans of time to find someone like you
Fell head over heels in love, without a clue
Us together, seems too good to be true
When it comes to you, I will come through

You invaded my heart
And now you own it
You're in my prayers
Our lives intertwined in layers

If life is literature,
You're my language
You're the story I want to live
You're the poetry I want to write.

## Withdrawal

The world feels hollow, empty, bare,
As I try to cope with the loss I bear
My heart aches with every beat,
As I struggle to accept my defeat.

You were my sun, my shining light,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
But now you're gone, and I'm alone,
Left to face the pain on my own.

The memories we shared, they linger on,
Haunting me with what's now gone.
Your laughter, your smile, your gentle touch,
All gone now, I miss you so much.

I wish I could turn back time,
To when you were still by my side.
But life goes on, and I must go too,
Though without you, it feels untrue.

I'll carry you with me in my heart,
A precious treasure that will never depart.
Though you're no longer here with me,
Your love will live on, eternally.

So rest in peace, my love, my friend,
Until we meet again in the end.
And though I'll miss you every day,
I'll cherish the love we shared, come what may.

## Anhedon

The love that once burned bright and strong,
Has now dwindled, faded long.
The flame that lit our hearts ablaze,
Has now been quenched, lost in the haze.

The moments we shared, they seem so far,
Like a distant and forgotten star.
The laughter, the joy, the tender touch,
All now gone, I miss them so much.

The feelings I had, they've slipped away,
And I'm left with an emptiness to sway.
I wish I could turn back the clock,
But it seems my heart has taken a knock.

I don't know why my love has waned,
Why the passion that was once ingrained,
Has now faded, lost in time,
Leaving behind an empty chime.

But I know that I must move on,
For life goes on, and I must be strong.
I'll cherish the memories that we shared,
And look forward to the love that's yet to be bared.

For though the feelings have slipped away,
And the love has now seen its day,
I'll always hold a place for you,
In the heart that once loved you true.

## Heartbreak

Time is known to heal all wounds
And it would - if only it could
Yet these wounds cannot be healed
With permanent scars, they are sealed

Locked inside is all the pain
Which cannot be washed away even by the heaviest rain
If only you could feel how much it hurts
Yet I would not wish that you even be cursed

This pain is a dagger that stabs my heart
And pricks every second till it tears apart
Like a flower whose petals have died
All I feel is an emptiness inside

Though for you, my heart weeps a flood
You are not to blame for this bad blood 
I have to let you go even though you were never mine
It was my mistake to think that we would work out just fine

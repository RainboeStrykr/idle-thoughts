Let’s say I take a rat and put him in a water tank. How long do you reckon it might survive? 1 hour? 45 minutes? And when the rat looks miserable and on the verge of death, I take it out and for the next 2 hours, I treat it like a king by drying him and giving him good food and rest.

The next day I repeated this procedure. How long do you think this time it will survive in the tank? 2 hours? No, it holds on to dear life this time for a staggering 9 hours. Here lies the lesson. The rat lived on for much more time because it had hope for a better time, a better time where it would be taken care of and fed. Hope can and will be the factor that helps us to endure life.

After all, you just need to keep swimming in life

Also, a thing I think everyone should know is the essence of belief.

Belief can move mountains. Yes, I said it.

Suppose you are in a pickle (not the one you’re supposed to eat), and if you believe something to be the sole cause behind that, it will become the reason even if there is no link between both of them. Belief in oneself is as important as belief in your friends and loved ones. \n

And yes, problems are real, struggles are real. We can’t possibly understand the gravity of someone else’s problems if we aren’t involved.

So if this write-up has been of any help, hope on and believe in yourself because times change, they always do. For the better. 

If you’ve reached here, you might have concluded that the author is sad or depressed. Maybe you aren’t half wrong but that’s not the point. The said point being emotions can be a very good coping mechanism for your situations. Express in excess till you are empty.

That’s enough philosophy for the day!

Ciao!
